  <h2>About the show</h2>

  <p>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> is the basis of scientific knowledge. A null hypothesis is essentially the common-sense, or even skeptic interpretation of the world, as we understand it — the status quo, the way we expect things to happen.</p>

  <p>This series will aim to tackle controversial topics with a 'null hypothesis' in mind. Our first topic will be Ageing. And our null hypothesis is that ageing is an inevitable biological process, and it is an inherent consequence of life.</p>

  <p>What if aging is not inevitable and not an inherent part of life? Perhaps it is a biological process that has been shaped by natural selection — but one that we can slow, or even reverse with pharmaceutical or non-pharma interventions?</p>

  <p>We will take a deep dive into the history, the latest research in the field, try to think through its implications on medicine and on society — to put together as complete of a picture as we can. And at the end of it all, we try to see if we can convince ourselves — and you! – to adopt a more interesting alternative hypothesis.</p>

  <h2>About the hosts</h2>
  <p><strong>River Jiang —</strong> I'm a medical student, and before that, I studied immunology. I've worked in molecular biology labs in the past, doing projects on epigenetics and pathogenic bacteria. Although I'm, of course, fond of biology, I relish in knowledge in general. Interesting and novel ideas are the currency I value most, and I hope that this will be an opportunity and an excuse for me to expand and share my collection.</p>

  <p><strong>Robyn Edgar —</strong>  I produce many podcasts including CanCon at BetaKit, and I also work at Hifyre, a digital product studio in Hamilton. Before radio, I studied computer science and Arctic microbiology. It was only once I was out on a boat, in the Arctic, for a field season during my Masters, that I realized my passion about science communication — perhaps than I was about doing the actual science itself.  I spent a month on board the CCGS Louis S. St. Laurent, and nearly every second of my free time was spent filming and editing together a short documentary on Arctic research science from GoPro footage that I’d painstakingly gathered in the unforgiving elements of the Arctic.</p>
