      <p>Welcome to Null Hypothesis, the podcast! Our site is currently under maintenance, please check back later.</p>

<p>Our goal for each series is to state a broad “null hypothesis” and then use current events, and the most recent research to either support or refute that statement. Our backgrounds are both in molecular biology, but the aim of our podcast is to bring interesting science to a general audience without reducing the research and current events to soundbites.  We’d be going up until the limits of current understanding on each topic we approach, and present relevant findings (and their nuances) even if they might be contradictory.  Within a season, we will be providing mini-series collections that will be four episodes long.  Each will have a specific theme.</p>
